## Q1-Finding value of π using Monte Carlo Method
Using Monte Carlo method, I took a square from x=-1 to x=+1 and y=-1 to y=+1 and inscribed a
circle of radius 1 unit inside the square. Now, I randomly started dropping points inside square. We can
say that the number of points falling inside the circle (nIn) divided by the total no. of points dropped
on the square (n) is given by Area of circle divided by Area of square. So value of πis :
π = 4 ∗ (nIn/n)
